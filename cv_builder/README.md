# cv_builder

I realised I was spending a lot of time with redundant tasks while applying for work. For example, I was manually naming
cover letters for future retrieval, with details such as organization name, date, position, and location. I was also
logging my applications in a separate csv file just to keep track of everything going on. 

The app_tracker.py is an ongoing attempt to resolve the problems faced above. I got the chance to experiment with some
new modules, and learn some new tricks along the way. 

Feel free to give recommendations or ask any questions you may have. I am assuming the general structure of this code
could be used for other routine file-naming and editing/logging tasks.
